					<p>
						ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! I'm Margo, currently leading growth at Sphere - a tech platform for coaching. 
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						I lived in the UK and Canada and worked in all things tech, marketing and events for the past eight years. 
						I've had the opportunity to work for small and big companies like The Telegraph, Tecknuovo and European Parliament.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						I'm not your average marketing pro â€” with my entrepreneurial mindset, I always try to sprinkle innovation and creativity like fairy dust to meet customer needs and surpass their expectations. 
						My mission is to instill memorable customer experiences that build long-lasting bonds with brands. ðŸ™‚
					</p>

					<p>I firmly believe in the power of coaching, and through implementing mentorship and coaching techniques in my leadership, I do my best to instill a growth mindset within individuals and teams.
						When you work with me, you'll get the support needed to explore new ideas, challenge the status quo, and push the boundaries of what's possible.</p>

				<h2 class="section-title">Out of Office</h2>
				<div class="content">
					<p>Outside office hours, you'll find me conquering majestic peaks and sharing my passion for mountain exploration. 
						I'm a trail runner, hiker and (toddler level) rock climber. I love guiding adrenaline-pumping mountain escapades, sharing my passion for the outdoors like a pro-Gandalf. 
						And as a level 2 ski instructor, I transform ordinary folks into slope-shredding warriors, igniting their love for the slopes with an avalanche of enthusiasm!</p>
